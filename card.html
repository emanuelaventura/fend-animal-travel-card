			<p>The sun conure is a medium-sized, vibrantly colored parrot.
				It is noted for its very loud squawks and screams and is popular as pet because of its </br>
				bright coloration and curious nature.</br>
				Due to their inquisitive temperaments, they demand a great deal of
				attention from their owners, with whom they can be loving and cuddly.</br>
				Hand-reared pets can be very friendly towards people with whom they are familiar,
				but they may be aggressive with strangers and even territorial with visitors.</br>
				Sun conures are capable of learning many tricks and can even perform in front of a live audience. </br>
			  In captivity, their lifespans range from 15 to 30 years. <br/>
				They are now listed as endangered by the IUCN. </p>
